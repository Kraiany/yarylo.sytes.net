<i>JumpTV offers 3 best local channels live providing coverage to the parliamentary election campaign 2007 in Ukraine: TV5, Inter+, 1+1 International</i><br />
<br />
DUBAI, September 19th, 2007 - JumpTV Inc. (<a class="wiki external"  href="http://example.com/" rel="external">www.jumptv.com</a><img border="0" class="externallink" src="img/icons/external_link.gif" alt=" (external link)" />), the world's leading broadcaster of ethnic television over the Internet, offers coverage of the early parliamentary elections campaign in Ukraine over its Internet television platform.<br />
JumpTV provides a great opportunity for Ukrainian diaspora to witness all the details of the rigid struggle for power and influence in the state that has recently celebrated its 16th anniversary of Independence.<br />
<br />
A short  story<br />
<br />
The campaign for Ukraine's early parliamentary elections has officially begun, giving candidates 60 days to present their bids before elections on September 30. The early elections are aimed at solving a bitter power struggle between western-leaning President Viktor Yushchenko and pro-Moscow Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.<br />
The dispute was sparked by Yushchenko's decision to dissolve parliament, taken in response to what Yushchenko said was an attempt by Yanukovych's parliamentary majority to usurp power. The major political parties have already held conventions to approve their manifestos and candidates for the polls.<br />
The main contenders in this year's preterm elections are the same as those in the regular parliamentary elections in March 2006: the Party of Regions, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, the Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense<a href="tiki-editpage96c6.html?page=Self-Defense" title="Create page: Self-Defense" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> bloc, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. The only difference is that the Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense<a href="tiki-editpage96c6.html?page=Self-Defense" title="Create page: Self-Defense" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> bloc was just Our Ukraine last year, without the People's Self-Defense<a href="tiki-editpage96c6.html?page=Self-Defense" title="Create page: Self-Defense" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> component later created by former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko.<br />
